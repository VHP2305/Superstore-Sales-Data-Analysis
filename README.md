# Superstore-Sales-Data-Analysis

* **Objective :** Using Power BI and Tableau to create a dynamic dashboard that allows sales teams to visualize and analyze sales data for different products, customer segments, and regions to optimize sales strategy, forecast sales, and identify growth opportunities.

* This sales data visualization uses Power BI / Tableau to create interactive charts and graphs that track sales performance over time. The visualizations are easy to understand and provide valuable insights into sales trends, such as which products are selling well, which regions are generating the most revenue, and which sales channels are most effective.

The visualizations are also customizable, so you can tailor them to your specific needs. For example, you can filter the data by product, region, or sales channel. You can also drill down into the data to see more detailed information.

This sales data visualization is a powerful way of presenting data that can help you track your sales performance and make informed decisions about your business.
